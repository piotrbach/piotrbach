### Hi! I'm Piotr.  ðŸ‘‹

I'm a .NET Architect and Umbraco expert, holding dual degrees in Computer Science (M.Sc.) and Mathematics (M.S.).

I've been involved in commercial programming since 2008, which gives me over a decade of experience in this field. 

My professional journey is fueled by a deep passion for developing complex web solutions. 

I primarily focus on the Umbraco platform, which I consider the ultimate content management framework for fostering business growth and innovation.

I take great pleasure in sharing my knowledge and learnings.
